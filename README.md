# intro-programming
Dive into fundamental and most basic of programming or coding.

I was from a different background, to be exact, Applied Science student. But that's does not mean I don't really know about something robot stuff (joke ðŸ˜„).
I meant blindly do not know about computer and tech. Thankful to my family siblings especially my dad, that introduced me to use computer.
So, I got to used old Windows where the interface super basic, greyish, non-HD, grain looking. I still remember the old time where I played games with my siblings. 

OK. That is enough for the background of young me.

- I was introduced officially to programming by admission to the Bachelor Degree level. It is Multimedia Computing. So it kind of mixed multimedia with programming. Unofficially through just my eager self to know how to develop a web. 
HTML and CSS is my early age even I know it is just styling and markup language. It is still a step further to know about Computer Science, right?

## Programming journey
Definitely exciting and tired one

- C was my first official programming language (exclude HTML and CSS a few years back)
- Feeling anxious if I could pull it through or not but eventually finished my first year in university (July 2023)
- Data Structure quite hard for me to imagine/remember the structure but easy through visual presentation
- Started learning new language in August till now. Alley-OOP (Java)

## Anything beside programming?
The answer is yes. I have been interested in data analyst, visualization and the improvement of AI topic. Hopefully can dive into Data Visualization later.
