# Introduction to Programming in C

This repository contains a collection of code examples and exercises for learning the C programming language. 
The code examples are designed to be easy to understand and follow, and the exercises are designed to help you practice your C programming skills.

To use this repository, simply clone it to your computer and open the README.md file in a text editor.

Start with the basics. Learn about syntax, variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
> Practice writing code regularly. The more code you write, the better you will become at it.

Process of the code inside the C Programming

C is a procedural programming language, which means that programs are written as a series of steps. These steps are called functions.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be used to perform a specific task. For example, you might have a function to print a message to the console or to calculate the sum of two numbers.

Functions can be called from other functions, which allows you to break down your program into smaller, more manageable pieces.

C programs typically have a main function, which is the entry point for the program. This is the function that is called when the program is executed.

The main function usually calls other functions to perform the tasks that the program needs to complete.

For example, the following C program prints the message "Hello, world!" to the console:


```
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

The `printf()` function is a standard library function that prints a message to the console. The \n character at the end of the message tells the printf() function to print a new line character.

The `return 0` statement at the end of the main function tells the operating system that the program has finished executing and that it should return control to the operating system.

Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available online and in libraries that can help you learn C programming.
I hope you enjoy learning C programming despite it is in fact **one of the oldest programming language**!

> [!NOTE]
> You need a C compiler or IDE to run them. I use DevC++ as the IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment). You can use from other software or run on Web C compiler.
