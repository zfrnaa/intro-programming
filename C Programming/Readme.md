# Introduction to Programming in C

This repository contains a collection of code examples and exercises for learning the C programming language. 
The code examples are designed to be easy to understand and follow, and the exercises are designed to help you practice your C programming skills.

To use this repository, simply clone it to your computer and open the README.md file in a text editor.

Start with the basics. Learn about syntax, variables, data types, operators, and control flow statements.
> Practice writing code regularly. The more code you write, the better you will become at it.

Don't be afraid to ask for help. There are many resources available online and in libraries that can help you learn C programming.
I hope you enjoy learning C programming despite it is in fact **one of the oldest programming language**!

Here a few resources I've been look while learning C:


[Geeks-for-geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-examples/)

[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming) (my most go to resource)

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/c/index.php)

> [!NOTE]
> You need a C compiler or IDE to run them. I use DevC++ as the IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment). You can use from other software or run on Web C compiler.
