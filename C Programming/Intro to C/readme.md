# History and Introduction to C language

C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. 
It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is used to develop a wide variety 
of software, including operating systems, embedded systems, and application software.

Also a compiled language, which means that C programs are converted into machine code before they are executed. 
This makes C programs very efficient, but it also makes them more difficult to debug.

## Syntax

1. C has a simple and straightforward syntax. Here is a summary of the basic syntax:
2. C is a case-sensitive language.
3. All statements must end with a semicolon (;).
4. C uses curly braces ({}) to group statements together.
5. C uses indentation to indicate the scope of a block of code.

## Important things to have in C code

- A main() function: This is the entry point for all C programs.
- Data types: C has a variety of data types, such as int, float, char, and void.
- Variables: Variables are used to store data.
- Operators: Operators are used to perform operations on data.
- Control flow statements: Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program.
- Functions: Functions are used to group together related code and to reuse code.

C is a great language to learn for anyone who wants to be a professional software developer. 
It is also a good language to learn for anyone who wants to understand how computers work. I can confirm. It is like the fundamental for everybody.

Here are some examples of software that is written in C:

```
1. Operating systems: Linux, macOS, and Windows.
2. Embedded systems: microcontrollers and microprocessors.
3. Application software: Popular application software programs, such as Google Chrome and the VLC media player.

Most commonly used **format specifier** in C are

|Format     | code   |
|-----------|:------:|
|character  | %c     | 
|string     | %s     |
|integer    | %d     |
|float      | %f     |
|long-float | %lf    |

Most commonly used **keyword** in C are

|Action              | Keyword         |
|--------------------|:---------------:|
|Display message     | printf          |
|Get input           | scanf           |
|Return back value   | return          |
|No return value     | void            |
|Integer             | int             |
|Float               | float           |
|Long-float          | double          |
|For looping         | for             |
|while looping       | while           |
|Do while looping    | do...while      |
|Menu                | switch...case   |
|Exit code line      | break           |
|Continue run        | continue        |
|Proceed to specific line | goto       |
|Condition           | if, else if, else |
